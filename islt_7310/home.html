      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <h3>Welcome to my portfolio website!!</h3>
      <p>On this website, you are going to know more about me, my accomplishments 
        and personal reflections during my study in the Learning Technology and 
        Design program at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p>
      <p>This website is used not only to showcase my personality and attributes, 
        but also to exhibit my skills, knowledge, and experiences of using different
        technology tools and instructional design principles and techniques to create 
        effective and relevant learning experiences for learners. You will see several 
        projects I created in different courses and how I integrated them into my own 
        classroom to support students' learning.</p>
      <p>This website is also a place where I share my self-reflections, aspirations,
        and goals to examine and motivate myself. It is where I dive deeper into my own 
        learning and evaluate my professional growth.</p>
      <p>My study in the program was a great learning journey for me, and I am 
        glad to share it with you here…</p>
