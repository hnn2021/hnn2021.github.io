          Project 1<br>
          This online learning module is designed to teach second-grade 
          students about food chains in an interactive and engaging way. 
          Three digital media works I created are embedded in the project 
          to effectively deliver the content. The digital video serves as
           a hook to attract and entertain students at the beginning of the 
           lesson. It is a puppet show that engages young students in learning 
           how energy is transferred from one living thing to another living 
           thing by eating and being eaten in a food chain. The image is used 
           as the main element to teach the key concepts with a vivid food chain
            example. The audio is aimed to provide a more detailed interpretation 
            of the image to better support student learning.

          Project 2 <br>
          This board game is designed to reinforce players' math knowledge and skills
           related to U.S. money via game playing. The goal of this board game is for 
           players to help Zoombinis to be the first one that collects $300. This game 
           has a 6-sided dice, a spinner, three categories of question cards with their
            answer cards, a deck of function cards, coins and bills, a game board and 
            the Zoombini game pieces. Players roll the dice to move their game pieces and 
            collect the money shown in the space where their game pieces land. Then, players
             spin a spinner to determine what categories of cards they draw. If they draw a 
             trivia card of a certain category, they need to answer the question correctly to 
             earn extra money. If they draw a function card, they need to carry out the action 
             described in the card.

          Project 3 <br>
          This is a group project for instructional design that I participated in. In this 
          project, the team worked together to identify a performance problem of phonics 
          teaching at the Mullanphy Botanical Elementary School via need assessment and 
          gap analysis. After conducting the learner analysis, contextual analysis and 
          task analysis, the team designed and developed a training program for the teachers
           to better implement phonics instruction.
