        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> My name is Nannan Huang. I am from <strong>China</strong>. 
            Currently, I live in St. Louis, Missouri. </p>
        <p> I completed my <strong>undergraduate </strong>degree at
             Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri in 2015. I studied 
             Elementary Education in the Education program. I graduated 
             with a teaching certificate. After graduation, I became an 
             educator. I have been a <em>bilingual </em>teacher for seven 
             years at St. Louis Language Immersion School. As a teacher, I
            am eager to learn about new technology to support student success. </p>
        <p>In 2021, I started to pursue my <em>master's</em> degree at the 
            University of Missouri-Columbia. I am majoring in Learning Technology 
            and Design. My goal of learning is to improve my ability of creating 
            effective learning environments for all learners. I anticipate graduating 
            in December 2023.
        <p> Outside my work, I enjoy traveling. I love to explore 
            different cities and learn about different landmarks and cultures. Traveling 
            around the world is my ultimate life goal!</p>
