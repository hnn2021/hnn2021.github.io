         <h3> Learning Competency</h3>
         <p class="para1"> Design and develop instruction using emerging technologies such as VR or game-based or simulation-based learning. </p>
         <h3> Project Description</h3>
         <p class="para1"> This board game is designed to reinforce players' math knowledge and skills related to U.S. money through gameplay. 
          The goal of the board game is for players to help Zoombinis be the first to collect $300. The game includes a 6-sided dice, a spinner, 
          three categories of question cards with their corresponding answer cards, a deck of function cards, coins and bills, a game board, and 
          Zoombini game pieces.Players roll the dice to move their game pieces and collect the money shown on the space where their game pieces 
          land. Then, they spin the spinner to determine which category of cards they draw. If they draw a trivia card from a specific category, 
          they need to answer the question correctly to earn extra money. If they draw a function card, they must carry out the action described on the card.
          Overall, the game aims to strengthen players' math skills related to U.S. money while engaging them in an enjoyable and educational gaming experience.</p>
         <h3> Self-reflection</h3>
       
         <p class="para1">  This learning experience has provided me with a deeper understanding of designing educational games. Incorporating high-order 
          thinking skills into games and assessing those learning objectives in a game-focused way was both insightful and challenging throughout the 
          process of designing this game. Looking back, if I were to redo this process now, I would make some changes to the game board layout and
           mechanics to enhance its appeal, engagement, and educational focus. Instead of simply labeling the amount of money on all spaces, I would
            transform some spaces into thematic stores, such as pet stores, candy stores, and bakery stores. By doing so, players would have a more 
            immersive experience and feel connected to the game world. Moreover, I would introduce challenges in these spaces that align with the higher-order 
            learning goals I want the players to achieve. These challenges could involve solving math problems related to buying items from the stores, managing 
            finances, or making strategic decisions based on the available money. Incorporating these changes would not only make the game more enjoyable but
             also provide a meaningful context for players to apply their math knowledge and skills related to U.S. money. It would also promote critical thinking, 
             decision-making, and problem-solving, all of which are valuable skills that players can benefit from beyond the game.Overall, this reflection has
              inspired me to continually strive for improving my game design skills and create more appealing and impactful learning experiences for players.</p>
