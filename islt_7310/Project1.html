         <h4>See The Project</h4>
         <br>
         <h3> Learning Competency</h3>
         <p class="para1">Develop proficiency in designing and delivering online instruction for K-12, corporate, university or non-profit settings. </p>
         <h3> Project Description</h3>
         <p class="para1"> This online learning module is designed to teach second-grade students about food chains in an interactive and engaging way. 
             Three digital media works I created are embedded in the project to effectively deliver the content.

            The digital video serves as a hook to attract and entertain students at the beginning of the lesson. It is a puppet show 
            that engages young students in learning how energy is transferred from one living thing to another living thing by eating and 
            being eaten in a food chain.
            
            The image is used as the main element to teach the key concepts with a vivid food chain example. The audio is aimed to provide
             a more detailed interpretation of the image to better support student learning. The use of the African drum beat, background 
             music, and animal sounds is intended to create an African Safari atmosphere to help students make real-life connections with the lesson.
            
            Interactive knowledge checks are integrated to help learners self-monitor their learning and check their understanding.</p>
         <h3> Self-reflection</h3>
       
         <p class="para1">  This learning experience has significantly enhanced my knowledge and skills in using the C.R.A.P design principle and 
            various design tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, to create engaging and effective instructional 
            content that facilitates student learning. Additionally, I successfully utilized the online platform Genially to develop an 
            interactive learning module for students.
            
            To ensure the project's quality, a project usability and learning evaluation were conducted, gathering constructive feedback 
            from experts and a student representative. This process provided me with a profound understanding of the importance and helpfulness 
            of the evaluation step in instructional design.
            
            Overall, this experience has been invaluable in broadening my expertise and empowering me to create more compelling and impactful 
            instructional materials to support and enhance student learning.</p>
