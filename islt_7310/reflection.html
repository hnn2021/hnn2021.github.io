         <h2>My Personal Reflection</h1>
         <h3> ADDIE Model and Me</h2>
         
            <P id="para1"> My study in the Learning Technology and Design program has been a wonderful 
                journey with tremendous personal and professional growth. For this reflection, 
                I would like to focus on my learning experience with the ADDIE model to share with 
                you one example of how I learned in this program.</P>

            <p class="para"> The acronym ADDIE stands for analyze, design, develop, implement and evaluate.
                It is one of the most widely-used frameworks in Instructional Design. My first time
                learning about the ADDIE model was in the course of Front End Analysis in my second 
                semester of learning in the program, in which I gained some basic understanding of 
                the model with an emphasis on the analyzing aspect. I conducted different types of analysis
                in that course, including performance analysis, task analysis, and data analysis, which I 
                found very interesting. Afterwards, I took another two courses, Introduction to Digital Media 
                and Design Games for Learning. These two classes greatly engaged me in the process of designing 
                and developing engaging and meaningful contents and games for learning. They helped me dig deeper 
                into the fascinating world of instructional design.</p>

            <p class="para"> Later, I took another course named Instructional System Design. My work in that course deepened 
                my understanding, knowledge and skills in the field of instructional design. It provided me with
                a great opportunity to not only learn about what each step of the ADDIE model is and the rationale
                behind each step, but also to experience the entire process of how to actually implement this model
                through the hand-on project with a group of teammates who have different work experience, work styles, 
                and personal background. Through the team project, my skills of data collecting and analyzing, instruction 
                alignments, communication, time management, collaboration and problem solving were greatly improved. </p>

            <p class="para"> This is such a great example of how I have gradually acquired essential and relevant knowledge and
                skills in this well-designed program in the past two years of learning. I have applied a lot of what
                 I learned into real world situations and integrated projects I created into my own teaching, 
                and I will continue to make the most of the knowledge and skills to create effective and meaningful 
                learning experiences for all learners. </p>
