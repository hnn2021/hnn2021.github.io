         <h3> Project Description</h3>
         <p class="para1"> 
          This is an instructional design group project in which I actively participated. The focus of the project was to address a performance problem 
          related to phonics teaching at Mullanphy Botanical Elementary School. Our team employed need assessment and gap analysis methodologies to 
          identify the areas for improvement. After conducting a learner, a contextual, and a task analysis, we developed a targeted training program 
          for teachers. By addressing the performance problem through this meticulously designed training program, we aimed to enhance the overall 
          learning experience for the students and contribute positively to the school's academic environment.Overall, this project exemplified the 
          significance of instructional design in tackling teaching challenges and creating tailored solutions to improve educational outcomes.
          It also highlighted the value of teamwork and collaboration in achieving success in such initiative
          </p>
         <h3> Self-reflection</h3>
         <p class="para1">  The completion of this group project enabled me to achieve my goal of creating a meaningful learning experience for adult 
          learners. Our team designed a specialized training program to enhance elementary teachers' knowledge and proficiency in phonics instruction. 
          Collaboratively, we analyzed the school's phonics teaching needs, considered the learners' perspectives (both teachers and students), assessed 
          the instructional context, and refined the content accordingly. Additionally, we developed the instruction and devised evaluation plans to 
          ensure the effectiveness of the training program. Throughout the journey, we encountered various challenges that provided numerous opportunities 
          for personal and professional growth. Overall, it was a wonderful and rewarding learning experience.</p>
